# AutoML demo

Please find the demo as the Jupyter notebook. Before running the demo, you would need to download the Airbnb dataset we used in HW3 from <https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnblala/data#>, and also install `auto-sklearn` and `TPOT`. The installation guides are:

- auto-sklearn (may only work on Linux): <https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/installation.html#installation>

- TPOT: <http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/installing/>

The Oboe system is developed by us and is still in progress of development (at <https://github.com/udellgroup/oboe>). Suggestions are welcomed!
